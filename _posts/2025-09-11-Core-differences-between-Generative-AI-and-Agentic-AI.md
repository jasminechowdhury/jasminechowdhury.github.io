  Core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI
</h1>
---

## Introduction
The terms 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' have both recently become very pertinent within the field of technology and particularly has a significant impact in many other sectors, changing some ways in which tasks used to be carried out.
Despite their prescence, many people are still unaware of the core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI. In this post, I will outline what they both mean individually, then breakdown how they differ from each other and other aspects surronding both terms.

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a machine-learning model that utilises the data it has been trained on to create new content such as videos, images, audio and text.

## Example of Generative AI
To understand Generative AI better, this is typically shown when you give chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot or Gemini a prompt (an input) to do something which then produces the desired result (the output). This can be seen in the image below 'Figure 1: Generative AI in action'.

- Define in simple terms: moves from **reactive** (waiting for commands) to **autonomous** (achieving goals).  
- Analogy: reactive AI is a **GPS giving directions**; agentic AI is a **chauffeur who drives you there**.

## How It Works (in Plain English)
Break into 3–4 simple building blocks:  
1. **Memory** – remembers what’s happened so far.  
2. **Planning** – breaks big goals into smaller steps.  
3. **Tools** – uses apps, browsers, or APIs to act.  
4. **Autonomy** – decides the next step without constant input.

## Example Scenario
- Use a **business case** (e.g. online shop):  
   - Reactive AI: suggests marketing tips.  
   - Agentic AI: analyses sales, drafts emails, runs ads, tracks results.  
- Optional: add another example like **AI coding agent** (tests/debugs/pushes updates).

---

## Why It Matters
- **Patents/IP** → surge of filings around autonomous agents, memory systems, and planning algorithms.  
- **Consulting** → companies need advice on ROI, adoption, and risk management.  
- **Law & Regulation** → who’s responsible if the AI “does” something harmful?  
- **Society** → could transform productivity, but raises control + trust questions.

---

## Challenges & Open Questions
- Reliability (AI can go off-track).  
- Safety (prevent harmful actions).  
- Legal & ethical accountability.  
- Over-hype vs. real capabilities.

---

## Conclusion
- Reiterate: agentic AI = **AI that acts, not just advises**.  
- Close with a reflective line: *“The technology is still young, but the questions it raises — about autonomy, responsibility, and opportunity — are urgent today.”*
