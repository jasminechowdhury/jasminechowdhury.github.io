# Core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI
---



## Introduction
The terms 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' have both recently become very pertinent within the field of technology and particularly has a significant impact in many other sectors, changing some ways in which tasks used to be carried out.
Despite their prescence, many people are still unaware of the core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI. In this post, I will outline what they both mean individually, then breakdown how they differ from each other and the impact of both using a PESTLE analysis 



## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a machine-learning model that utilises the data it has been trained on to create new content such as videos, images, audio and text.

## Example of Generative AI
To understand Generative AI better, this is typically shown when you give chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot or Gemini a prompt (an input) to do something which then produces the desired result (the output). This can be seen in the image below:

- From here, you can see how ChatGPT 5 fulfills the prompt request from the start to finish


## How does Generative AI work?
Generative AI has its own process of ensuring the result (output) produced is relevant to the users' needs and meets their request as seen in the diagram below:

1) Data training = The AI is given tons of content such as videos, images, audio and text based on its purpose.
2) Recognising patterns = Rather than memomrising everything, the AI identifies patterns such as how words follow each other in a sentence
3) Patterns -> Probabilities = The AI essentially then turns into a machine that formulates predictions such as guessing what piece comes next in a puzzle
4) Creating prompts = When a user provides an AI with a prompt using a chatbot, such as 'Give me a easy recipe to make vanilla cupcakes', rather than copying another recipe word for word, the AI will use patterns to form its own version of the recipe
5) Output generated =  The patterns are eventually aligned by the AI, in which the outcome should fulfill the users' request

## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI is a machine-learning model that autonomously performs tasks and decision with limited or none human intervention. This is essentially an AI version of a personal assistant.

## Example of Agentic AI
To understand Agentic AI better, this is essentially asking an AI agent to fully act on the users' behalf. Whilst there are no public chatbots that can currently fully act on the user's behalf, The image below shows how this would work if users' had access to this sort of AI right now:

## Conclusion
- Reiterate: agentic AI = **AI that acts, not just advises**.  
- Close with a reflective line: *“The technology is still young, but the questions it raises — about autonomy, responsibility, and opportunity — are urgent today.”*
