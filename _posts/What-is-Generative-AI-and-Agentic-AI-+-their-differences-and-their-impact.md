# Core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI
---



## Introduction
The terms 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' have both recently become very pertinent within the field of technology and particularly has a significant impact in many other sectors, changing some ways in which tasks used to be carried out.
Despite their prescence, many people are still unaware of the core differences between Generative AI and Agentic AI. In this post, I will outline what they both mean individually, then breakdown how they differ from each other and the impact of both using a PESTLE analysis 



## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a machine-learning model that utilises the data it has been trained on to create new content such as videos, images, audio and text.

## Example of Generative AI
To understand Generative AI better, this is typically shown when you give chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot or Gemini a prompt (an input) to do something which then produces the desired result (the output). This can be seen in the image below:

- From here, you can see how ChatGPT 5 fulfills the prompt request from the start to finish


## How does Generative AI work?
Generative AI has its own process of ensuring the result (output) produced is relevant to the users' needs and meets their request as seen in the diagram below:

## Conclusion
- Reiterate: agentic AI = **AI that acts, not just advises**.  
- Close with a reflective line: *“The technology is still young, but the questions it raises — about autonomy, responsibility, and opportunity — are urgent today.”*
